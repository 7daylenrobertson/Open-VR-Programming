# Open-VR-Programming
As programmers, we tend to feel like we don't have much of a workspace when we are sitting at a desk. Have you ever wanted to walk around and code in your open environment? Now you can! Through this, you can have more thinking space as well as code comfortably in the car, in bed, even outside! All of this while still feeling like you have all the space in the world.
